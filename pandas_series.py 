# Use pandas to create a Series named fruits from the following list:
my_list = ["kiwi", "mango", "strawberry", "pineapple", "gala apple", "honeycrisp apple", "tomato", "watermelon","honeydew", "kiwi", "kiwi", "kiwi", "mango", "blueberry", "blackberry", "gooseberry", "papaya"]
my_fruit = pd.Series(my_list)
# Use Series attributes and methods to explore your fruits Series.
# Determine the number of elements in fruits.
my_fruit.count()
# Output only the index from fruits.
my_fruit.index
# Output only the values from fruits.
my_fruit.values
# Confirm the data type of the values in fruits.
my_fruit.describe
# Output only the first five values from fruits. Output the last three values. Output two random values from fruits.
my_fruit.head()
my_fruit.tail(3)
my_fruit.sample(2)
# Run the .describe() on fruits to see what information it returns when called on a Series with string values.
my_fruit.describe()
# Run the code necessary to produce only the unique string values from fruits.
my_fruit.unique()
# Determine how many times each unique string value occurs in fruits.
my_fruit.value_counts()
# Determine the string value that occurs most frequently in fruits.
my_fruit.mode()
# Determine the string value that occurs least frequently in fruits.
my_fruit.value_counts().nsmallest(keep='all')

# Exercises Part II
# Explore more attributes and methods while you continue to work with the fruits Series.

# Capitalize all the string values in fruits.

# Count the letter "a" in all the string values (use string vectorization).

# Output the number of vowels in each and every string value.

# Write the code to get the longest string value from fruits.

# Write the code to get the string values with 5 or more letters in the name.

# Find the fruit(s) containing the letter "o" two or more times.

# Write the code to get only the string values containing the substring "berry".

# Write the code to get only the string values containing the substring "apple".

# Which string value contains the most vowels?

# Exercises Part III

# Use pandas to create a Series named letters from the following string. 
# The easiest way to make this string into a Pandas series is to use list 
# to convert each individual letter into a single string on a basic Python list.

# Which letter occurs the most frequently in the letters Series?

# Which letter occurs the Least frequently?

# How many vowels are in the Series?

# How many consonants are in the Series?

# Create a Series that has all of the same letters but uppercased.

# Create a bar plot of the frequencies of the 6 most commonly occuring letters.

# Use pandas to create a Series named numbers from the following list:

# ['$796,459.41', '$278.60', '$482,571.67', '$4,503,915.98', '$2,121,418.3',
#  '$1,260,813.3', '$87,231.01', '$1,509,175.45', '$4,138,548.00', '$2,848,913.80',
#  '$594,715.39', '$4,789,988.17', '$4,513,644.5', '$3,191,059.97', '$1,758,712.24',
#  '$4,338,283.54', '$4,738,303.38', '$2,791,759.67', '$769,681.94', '$452,650.23']

# What is the data type of the numbers Series?

# How many elements are in the number Series?

# Perform the necessary manipulations by accessing Series attributes and
#  methods to convert the numbers Series to a numeric data type.

# Run the code to discover the maximum value from the Series.

# Run the code to discover the minimum value from the Series.

# What is the range of the values in the Series?

# Bin the data into 4 equally sized intervals or bins and output how many values fall into each bin.

# Plot the binned data in a meaningful way. Be sure to include a title and axis labels.

# Use pandas to create a Series named exam_scores from the following list:

# [60, 86, 75, 62, 93, 71, 60, 83, 95, 78, 65, 72, 69, 81, 96, 80, 85, 92, 82, 78]

# How many elements are in the exam_scores Series?

# Run the code to discover the minimum, the maximum, the mean, and the median scores for the exam_scores Series.

# Plot the Series in a meaningful way and make sure your chart has a title and axis labels.

# Write the code necessary to implement a curve for your exam_grades Series and
# save this as curved_grades. Add the necessary points to the highest grade to make it 100,
#  and add the same number of points to every other score in the Series as well.

# Use a method to convert each of the numeric values in the curved_grades Series into a categorical value of letter grades.
# For example, 86 should be a 'B' and 95 should be an 'A'. Save this as a Series named letter_grades.

# Plot your new categorical letter_grades Series in a meaninful way and include a title and axis labels.
